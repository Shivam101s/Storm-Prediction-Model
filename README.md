# Storm-Prediction-Model
Here we've ex[erimented with 4 different models, which is SVM, XG Boost, Random Forest and Deep Neural Networks. On each model we've performed two different experiments, first is doing experiment on a single model, second is having multiple models fro the classification (model for each fetaure), for the latter we gave the name Meta Model. We found that using our proposed meta-model approach, where individual models are trained on each feature and their predictions are combined into a final classifier, consistently outperforms the single model approach across all algorithms. This demonstrates the power of combining multiple models.
